## Description

This project is a web application for Delani studio that shows details about the services it offers, has information about the studio, a portfolio section and a form that enables users to send their messages and concern to Delani studios.  We have done a buildup on a previous project at Moringa School to showcase the use of node JS and deployment to Heroku.
